## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Working on this challenge helped me practice and improve:
- Writing semantic and accessible HTML
- Using Tailwind CSS utility classes to build responsive layouts
- Creating custom Tailwind configurations, such as extending themes for breakpoints and customizing fonts and colors
- Creating reusable styles for a component

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills with Tailwind CSS. While building this component, I got more comfortable using utility classes for layout and spacing, but Iâ€™d like to focus more on:
- Structuring larger, more complex layouts with Tailwind
- Making better use of Tailwind's responsive design utilities
- Improving consistency and maintainability when using utility-first CSS in real-world projects
